## About the Course

The instructor, Angela Yu, has been working as an iOS developer. Here are some notable features of the course:

- It's 55 hours, so be careful.
* You'll be building 25 apps.
* It contains optional modules on design and marketing.
* It contains the same content as the bootcamp.
## Syllabus Highlights

Below are parts in the upcoming syllabus that I found interesting.

- iOS / XCode Interface Builder
- iOS Development
- iOS Autolayout
	- ? What is AutoLayout?
 * reading Apple documentation
 * control flow and optionals
 * iOS design patterns
 * multi-screen applications
 * networking
 * SwiftUI
 * Firebase, auth
 * persistent storage
 * ML
 * augmented reality on iOS and ARKit
 * publishing
 * app design
 * app marketing

I'll probably be able to start comfortably building apps at the end of the course. I'll be able to watch all the video in 2 weeks.
## Extending Your Learning

## How Does an App Work?

An app is just code, and usually packaged with primitives like taps, swipes, drags, etc. It's built up around:

1. the UI
2. the code
	- the plan for what to do
3. data

Unlike a phone, a smartphone has:

1. less processing power
2. less battery life

iOS is the manager, telling you what the user is getting - called, switching your app to the background, etc. To prevent our app from shuddering in fear, we should write in our plan (the code) how to handle these cases.
## Building An App

1. ask yourself "why do you need an app?"
	- Oftentimes, the answer is that you don't. Some notable cases are:
		- tapping into sensors
		- sending push notifications
	- Validation is not ideal. Try doing something that requires much less validation:
		- build a landing page
		- build an MVP
2. validate your idea next
3. design the app
4. build it
5. test it, both manually and automated
6. publish!
7. get feedback and improve
## Benefits

You get:
1. a bunch of assets to use
2. gradients
3. photoshop files and sketches
4. app icon builders
